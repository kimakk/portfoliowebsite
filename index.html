    <h2>Letter of a Tree</h2>
    <h3>
      If a tree could speak, what would it say to the world? <br />
      In a project about creating a new design language, I researched
      sustainable ways <br />
      of creating paper and how it can ecologically-friendly decompose in
      nature.

    <h2>A Childhood Dream</h2>
    <h3>
      The overall topic for this film was supposed to be about a hut. <br />I
      remember a hut in my childhood playground and started to film some shots
      there. <br />
      When I started editing, I realised something was missing. It was the
      state of this world <br />and the children whose childhood and dreams
      are violently taken from them. <br />
      In this way, I wanted to show the contrast between these two worlds.

    <h2>Haagse Trots</h2>
    <h3>
      The Hague has been my home for the past three years now, and I've
      noticed a certain <br />type of pride for this city. The mullet has
      become a statement and is said to be from <br />
      The Hague, so a "Hague Mullet Atlas" has been published for example.
      This is one part <br />of the film where I research and dive into
      stories, people and buildings<br />
      that remind me why this certain pride exists.

    <h2>Alter Ego</h2>
    <h3>
      I like to give my archives a meaning, so when I had to create a project
      about an alter ego, <br />I came across an old voice memo, and started
      building a "world" around it <br />of an alter ego who is still the same
      person but is liberated from <br />the insecurities of an younger
      version of themselves.
